# List-KRforAdguardHome
My own little repo to make Adguard Home Compatible filter-list from List-KR \
This repo will pull from the List-KR repo once a week to create a full compilation of all the filter lists included in the List-KR

Might add more options/compilation results if the full compilation causes a problem down the line.
